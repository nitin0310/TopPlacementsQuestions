	 Go to left subtree and return the node with maximum key value in the left subtree.

	 If left subtree of node is NULL, then start from the root and use search like technique. Do the following. 
	 Travel down the tree, if a node’s data is greater than root’s data then go left side, otherwise, go to right side.
