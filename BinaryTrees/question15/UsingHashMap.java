/*
 simple funda--
 we store each parent as key,and arrayList for its children to store in order
 
 but for tree2 we do it reversely
 bcx if we store child reversely in arrayList at that particular parent key,
 then if it is mirrored then in both map 
 for tree1 and tree2 
 we found children in arrayList in same order,that's it
 
 O(n) time					O(n) space
