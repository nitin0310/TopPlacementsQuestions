 (By Storing root to n1 and root to n2 paths): 
Following is a simple O(n) algorithm to find LCA of n1 and n2. 
1) Find a path from the root to n1 and store it in a vector or array. 
2) Find a path from the root to n2 and store it in another vector or array. 
3) Traverse both paths till the values in arrays are the same. Return the common element just before the mismatch.
